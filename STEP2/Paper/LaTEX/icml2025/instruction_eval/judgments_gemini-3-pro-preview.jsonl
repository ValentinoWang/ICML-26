As a result , housing became expensive and agricultural land was turned into residential areas .\n\nExplanation :\nThe first sentence explains that the city experienced rapid growth after the construction of a railway line that connected it with other cities . This led to an increase in population as well as economic activity within the city limits . In order to accommodate this growth , many residents began looking for ways to improve their living conditions by purchasing homes closer to where they worked or studying at schools located near their place of residence . As a consequence of these changes , there was also a significant rise in property values across different neighborhoods throughout town . Additionally , some farmers decided to sell off portions of their land so they could build houses instead of continuing farming operations . With all these factors combined together , we can see how important it was for the city government to plan ahead when making decisions regarding infrastructure development projects such as building new roads or expanding public transportation systems .", "judge_raw": "A"}

Since then , many different implementations have been developed across various platforms such as Windows NT / XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 ; Linux ; Mac OS X ; iOS ; Android ; BlackBerry ; Palm WebOS ; Symbian ; Microsoft Windows Mobile ; Google Chrome OS ; Novell NetWare ; Novell Open Enterprise Server ; Novell S", "response_b": "An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of routines , protocols , and tools for building software applications .

The use of APIs allows developers to create applications that can interact with each other more easily than if they were built from scratch without any standardization at all . For example , consider two programs : one written in Java and another written in C ++ . If both use similar methods for performing certain tasks such as reading files or printing text then they may be able to communicate using an appropriate API rather than trying to figure out how to do so manually which could take months or even years depending on complexity level required . In addition many modern operating systems include their own set of prebuilt APIs allowing users to perform common tasks without writing new code every time they need something like opening a", "judge_raw": "B"}
